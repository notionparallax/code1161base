def advancedGuessingGame():
    """
    The exercise here is to rewrite the exampleGuessingGame() function
    from exercise 3, but to allow for:
    * a lower bound to be entered, e.g. guess numbers between 10 and 20
    * ask for a better input if the user gives a non integer value anywhere.
      I.e. throw away inputs like "ten" or "8!" but instead of crashing
      ask for another value.
    * chastise them if they pick a number outside the bounds.

    NOTE: whilst you CAN write this from scratch, and it'd be good for you to
    be able to eventually, it'd be better to take the code from exercise 2 and
    marge it with code from excercise 1.
    Remember to think modular. Try to keep your functions small and single
    purpose if you can!
